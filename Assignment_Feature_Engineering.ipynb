        "-We convert them into numbers using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
        "- Training data is used to teach the model, and testing data is used to check its performance.\n",

        "- It is a module in sklearn that contains linear models like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17.What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
